A crime has been committed, and the only way to solve it is by digging into the database! In this SQL Murder Mystery, I take on the role of a data detective, using logical thinking and precise SQL queries to track down the suspect.

By carefully examining tables, filtering through crime reports, and uncovering key details, I piece together the evidence to solve the case. This project showcases my ability to write efficient SQL queries, analyze structured data, and think critically—all while having some fun cracking the mystery!

The database holds the truth—let’s uncover it! 🔍💻
