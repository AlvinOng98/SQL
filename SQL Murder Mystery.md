A crime has been committed, and the only way to solve it is by digging into the database! In this SQL Murder Mystery, I take on the role of a data detective, using logical thinking and precise SQL queries to track down the suspect.

By carefully examining tables, filtering through crime reports, and uncovering key details, I piece together the evidence to solve the case. This project showcases my ability to write efficient SQL queries, analyze structured data, and think critically—all while having some fun cracking the mystery!

The database holds the truth—let’s uncover it! 🔍💻

## Clues at the Crime Scene Report

Let's start with the excerpt provided to us:

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
